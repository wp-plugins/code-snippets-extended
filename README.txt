Powerful plugin, that allows you to create code snippets & embed it into posts or pages easily.

Using this plugin, you can create code chunks(or snippets) and use them in posts or pages on your site.  

In one snippet you can use different code types: js, php, css, just set required tags.

*  `<?php ?>` - for php code,
*  `<script></script>`, - for js code,
*  `<style></style>` - for stylesheets.
